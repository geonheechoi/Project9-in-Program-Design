# Project9-in-Program-Design
Project 9, Program Design  1. (60 points) In project 8, a t-shirt is added to end of the linked list. Each t-shirt was stored  with the student organization name, size, price, and quantity in inventory. In this project,  you will modify the add_to_inventory function so a t-shirt is added to an ordered linked  list.  Name your file tshirt_store2.c.      a. Instead of adding to the end of the linked list, a t-shirt is added to an ordered  linked list by student organization name and then by size. The list remains  ordered after the t-shirt is added.    For example, a t-shirt for Association for Computing Machinery of size XS  should be before a t-shirt for Society of Competitive Programmers of size L; a t- shirt for Association for Computing Machinery of size XS should be after a t-shirt  for Association for Computing Machinery of size L.    2. (40 points) Modify project 7 so that it uses quick sort to sort the states by percentage of  population whose ages are equal or greater than 65 years old. Instead of using the sorting  function you wrote for project 7, use the quick sort library function and implement the  comparison function. Name your file demographics2.c.
